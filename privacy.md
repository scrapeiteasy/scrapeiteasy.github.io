# Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 5/13/25

Scrape It Easy ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and store information through our Chrome extension.

## 1. Information We Collect

We do **not** collect or store any personal information directly from users. The extension operates entirely within your browser and processes content locally unless license validation is required.

When you activate a Pro license, we may:

- Collect your license key for validation
- Send the license key to our API (hosted securely on Vercel) for verification
- Receive limited metadata (e.g., email address, plan type) via Lemon Squeezy, our payment and license management provider

We do **not** track user behavior, store content scraped from pages, or use any third-party analytics services within the extension.

## 2. License Activation

When activating a Pro key, your input is sent securely to our server to validate the license. No personal information is stored by us outside of the Lemon Squeezy platform.

## 3. Payment Processing

All payments are handled by [Lemon Squeezy](https://www.lemonsqueezy.com). We do not collect or process your credit card or billing details. Lemon Squeezy handles customer receipts, key delivery, and subscription management.

## 4. Data Retention

We do not retain any scraped content, browsing history, or user-entered URLs. All user interactions occur locally within your browser.

## 5. User Rights

Because we do not store personal data ourselves, there is nothing to access, delete, or modify. All license and subscription data is managed via your Lemon Squeezy account.

## 6. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. When we do, we will update the "Effective Date" at the top of this document.
